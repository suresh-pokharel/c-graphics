# c-graphics
This is a graphics work in C to make a car which may helps the Learns to learn about co-ordinates and different shapes rendering in C programmers.
This program basically creates a design of small car where dimension of car can be varied with the values of these variables x1,y1,x2,y2.
An obstacle (a simple vertical bar) is created randomly in the car's way. And car stops when it reaches the nearest point of the obstacle.

#Information
`void obstacle(int x1,int y1,int x2,int y2,int obs)`
This function creates obstacle.

`car(int x1,int y1,int x2,int y2,int obs)`
This function creates the car.

`void clearscreen()`
This function clears the screen.

`void countdown()`
This function shows 3..2..1..GO countdown at the beginning of program

`void rotatetyre(int x1,int y1,int x2,int y2,int i)`
This function is for good UI that shows like tyre is rotating.

`void timedelay()`
This is for some time delay. Simply a empty for loop.

`void snowfall()`
I tried to show like snowfalls but not working well.
